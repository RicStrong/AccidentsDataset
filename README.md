I wanted to recreate the popular "bar chart race" visualization in python. I found a great resource for building one using matplotlib, so this is my attempt at recreating that. Here we go!

I found a dataset on traffic accidents. I may want to do a count of traffic accidents per city (maybe for something more advanced, calculate traffic accidents over the population, not just total count).
