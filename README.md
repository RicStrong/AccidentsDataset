I wanted to recreate the popular "bar chart race" visualization in python to see how car accident rates changed over time among locations. I found a great resource for building one using matplotlib, so this is my attempt at recreating that. Here we go!

Update: Turns out it's a bit more difficult than expected with this type of data. I need to revisit this and find a way to establish counts for each and every city included before I can get it polished.
